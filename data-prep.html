            <p>
                A Study by Gartner estimates that 20% of all data is bad, and that bad data can have a significant negative impact on company operations. In fact, according to IBM, 2016, the yearly cost of poor quality data is $3,100,000,000,000.
            </p>

                In this webinar, we are going to dive deep and understand dirty and clean data and
                common
                Ms. Excel functions and formulas applied for data cleansing.

            <h2>
                Why clean data?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Business operations and decision-making are increasingly data-driven, as organizations look to use data
                analytics to help improve business performance and gain competitive advantages over rivals. As a result,
                clean data is a must for BI and data science teams, business executives, marketing managers, sales reps
                and
                operational workers. That's particularly true in retail, financial services, health, and other
                data-intensive industries, but it applies to organizations across the board, both large and small.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a piece of data is entered into spreadsheet or database incorrectly, or if it is repeated, or a feild
                is
                left blank, or data formats are Inconsistent; the result is dirty data. What might seem small can lead
                to
                big consequences in the long run.Imagine a payroll data that multiply an employee's working hour by two.
                Imagine a credit score system that rate a borrower higher than they deserve. Imagine a wrong account
                details
                shared with an employer. Just IMAGINE the cost of dirty data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, we can say that dirty data can lead to flawed business decisions, misguided strategies,
                missed
                opportunities and operational problems, which ultimately may increase costs and reduce revenue and
                profits.
                IBM estimated that data quality issues cost organizations in the U.S. a total of $3.1 trillion in 2016,
                a
                figure that's still widely cited.

            <h2>
                Characteristics of dirty data
            </h2>
            <p>
                Dirty data is incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant to the problem you're trying to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dirty data can be due to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Typo error
                    </strong> - This include misspellings, wrong numerical entries, leading, trailing, or double
                    spacing,
                    syntax errors and other typographical errors. The errors can be due to human errors during data
                    input or
                    data retrival from database or other software. This error can cause errors in Ms. Excel and other
                    analysis software function. Further, incorrect data leads to inaccurate insights or decision-making
                    based on bad information resulting in revenue loss.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Inconsistent formatting
                    </strong> - This is any data that uses different formats to represent the same thing. The common
                    example
                    is a currency column showing that include kenya shillings and US dollar or date column that takes US
                    and
                    European formats. This is caused by data inserted or stored incorrectly or errors inserted during
                    data
                    transfer, merging or retrival from database or different software tools. This error leads to
                    contradictory data points leading to confusion, wrong filtering and calculation results or inability
                    to
                    classify or segment customers (E.g country column having USA, and US in the same column).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Blank fields
                    </strong> - This is any data that is missing in the important feild. This error is caused by
                    improper
                    data collection of field validations, incorrect data entry or retrival, and erroneous deletion in
                    the
                    process data cleaning or analysis. This error leads to decreased productivity, inaccurate insights,
                    or
                    inability to complete essential services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Out of range values
                    </strong> - This is the value we can related to an outlier. The value not within the expected range.
                    This is caused by human error during data input, inconsistent format; showing number as a
                    percentage,
                    fake information or mock data. This error leads to biases, inaccurate insights or decision-making
                    based
                    on bad information resulting in revenue loss
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Duplicate values
                    </strong> - This is any data record that shows up more than once in a dataset.The error is caused by
                    manual data entry, batch data imports, or data migration. Such an error is costly as it leads to
                    skewed
                    metrics or analyses, inflated or inaccurate counts or predictions, or confusion during data
                    retrieval.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Outdated data
                    </strong> - This is any data that is old which should be replaced with newer and more accurate
                    information. This error is caused by people changing roles or companies, or software and systems
                    becoming obsolete or volatile data that changes quickly over time such as stock prices. This error
                    leads
                    to inaccurate analysis, insight and decision making.

            <h2>
                What is data cleaning?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Data cleaning also referred to as data cleansing or data scrubbing is the process of preparing data for
                analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or
                improperly
                formatted. It involves identifying data errors and then changing, updating or removing data to correct
                them.
                Data cleansing improves data quality and helps provide more accurate, consistent and reliable
                information
                for decision-making in an organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                Data cleansing is a key part of the overall data management process and one of the core components of
                data
                preparation work that readies data sets for use in business intelligence (BI) and data science
                applications.
                It's typically done by data quality analysts and engineers or other data management professionals. But
                data
                scientists, BI analysts and business users may also clean data or take part in the data cleansing
                process
                for their own applications.

            <h2>
                What are the steps in data cleaning?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The scope of data cleansing work varies depending on the data set and analytics requirements. For
                example, a
                data scientist doing fraud detection analysis on credit card transaction data may want to retain outlier
                values because they could be a sign of fraudulent purchases. But the data scrubbing process typically
                includes the following actions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Inspection and profiling
                    </strong> - First, data is inspected and audited to assess its quality level and identify issues
                    that
                    need to be fixed. This step usually involves data profiling, which documents relationships between
                    data
                    elements, checks data quality and gathers statistics on data sets to help find errors, discrepancies
                    and
                    other problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Cleaning
                    </strong> - This is the heart of the cleansing process, when data errors are corrected and
                    inconsistent,
                    duplicate and redundant data is addressed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Verification
                    </strong> - After the cleaning step is completed, the person or team that did the work should
                    inspect
                    the data again to verify its cleanliness and make sure it conforms to internal data quality rules
                    and
                    standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Reporting
                    </strong> - The results of the data cleansing work should then be reported to IT and business
                    executives
                    to highlight data quality trends and progress. The report could include the number of issues found
                    and
                    corrected, plus updated metrics on the data's quality levels.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
                Characteristics of clean data
            </h2>
            <p>
                Clean data is complete, correct, or relevant to the problem you're trying to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quality data is essential for making informed decisions and driving business success. To ensure that
                data is
                of high quality, it should meet five key characteristics. When cleaning data before using it for
                analysis or
                decision making, consider the following aspects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Validity
                    </strong> - Valid data adheres to the rules and constraints set for the specific data type or field.
                    Ensuring validity means checking that the data falls within the acceptable range of values and
                    follows
                    the correct format.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Accuracy
                    </strong> - Accurate data is free from errors and closely represents the true value. To ensure
                    accuracy,
                    data cleaning should involve identifying and correcting any incorrect or misleading information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Completeness
                    </strong> - Complete data contains all the necessary information and does not have any missing or
                    null
                    values. Data cleaning should involve filling in missing values or addressing incomplete records to
                    ensure a comprehensive dataset.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Consistency
                    </strong> - Consistent data maintains the same format, units, and terminology across the dataset.
                    Data
                    cleaning should involve identifying and resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies to ensure
                    uniformity and comparability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Uniformity
                    </strong> - Uniform data follows a standard format, making it easier to analyze and compare. Data
                    cleaning should involve converting data into a common format or structure, ensuring that it is
                    consistent and easy to work with.

            <h2>
                What are the benefits of clean data?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Done well, data cleansing provides the following business and data management benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Improved decision-making
                    </strong> - With more accurate data, analytics applications can produce better results. That enables
                    organizations to make more informed decisions on business strategies and operations, as well as
                    things
                    like patient care and government programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        More effective marketing and sales
                    </strong> - Customer data is often wrong, inconsistent or out of date. Cleaning up the data in
                    customer
                    relationship management and sales systems helps improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and
                    sales efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Better operational performance
                    </strong> - Clean, high-quality data helps organizations avoid inventory shortages, delivery snafus
                    and
                    other business problems that can result in higher costs, lower revenues and damaged relationships
                    with
                    customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Increased use of data
                    </strong> - Data has become a key corporate asset, but it can't generate business value if it isn't
                    used. By making data more trustworthy, data cleansing helps convince business managers and workers
                    to
                    rely on it as part of their jobs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Reduced data costs
                    </strong> - Data cleansing stops data errors and issues from further propagating in systems and
                    analytics applications. In the long term, that saves time and money, because IT and data management
                    teams don't have to continue fixing the same errors in data sets.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Data cleansing and other data quality methods are also a key part of data governance programs, which aim
                to
                ensure that the data in enterprise systems is consistent and gets used properly. Clean data is one of
                the
                hallmarks of a successful data governance initiative.
